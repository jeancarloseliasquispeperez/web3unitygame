The AI security model (`security_model.h5`) is designed to analyze smart contract security on the Solana blockchain.
It predicts vulnerabilities based on historical attack patterns and contract structure.
""",
    "Step 1: Install Dependencies": """
Before training the model, install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn
```
""",
    "Step 2: Create `train_security_model.py`": """
This script trains an AI model to classify smart contracts as either **safe** or **vulnerable**.

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate Sample Data (Smart Contract Risk Scores)
np.random.seed(42)
data_size = 5000

# Sample input features: gas usage, function count, event count, modifier count
X = np.random.rand(data_size, 4)

# Sample output: Risk score (0 = safe, 1 = vulnerable)
y = (X[:, 0] + X[:, 1] * 0.5 + X[:, 2] * 0.3 + X[:, 3] * 0.2) > 1.2
y = y.astype(int)

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define AI Model for Security Risk Classification

After training, the model can be used to analyze new smart contracts.

    "What This AI Model Does": """
✅ **Trains a neural network** to classify smart contracts as **safe or vulnerable**  
✅ **Uses historical attack patterns** to detect risks in **Solana contracts**  
✅ **Outputs a risk score** (higher score = more vulnerable contract)  
✅ **Saves the trained model** as `security_model.h5` for later use

    "Next Steps": """
To improve security analysis, consider training the model with more extensive smart contract attack data.
Future enhancements can include **gas optimization models** and **AI-based contract refactoring tools**.
