    "Introduction": """
The AI gas optimizer model (`gas_optimizer.h5`) is designed to analyze smart contracts on the Solana blockchain and suggest gas fee optimizations.
This model predicts the most efficient gas usage based on contract characteristics like opcode count, storage access, and loop depth.
""",
    "Step 1: Install Dependencies": """
Before training the model, install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn
```
""",
    "Step 2: Create `train_gas_optimizer.py`": """
This script trains an AI model to optimize gas fees for smart contracts.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate Sample Data (Gas Usage & Optimization Scores)
np.random.seed(42)
data_size = 5000

# Sample input features: contract size, opcode count, loop depth, storage access
X = np.random.rand(data_size, 4) * [1000, 500, 20, 300]

# Sample output: Optimized gas cost (lower is better)
y = (X[:, 0] * 0.4 + X[:, 1] * 0.3 + X[:, 2] * 0.2 + X[:, 3] * 0.1) * 0.8

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define AI Model for Gas Optimization Prediction
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(4,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(8, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='linear')  # Regression output (optimized gas cost)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error', metrics=['mae'])

# Train the Model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=16, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Save the trained model as gas_optimizer.h5
model.save("gas_optimizer.h5")
print("✅ Gas Optimization Model Saved as gas_optimizer.h5")
```

    "Step 3: Load & Use the Model": """
After training, the model can be used to analyze new smart contracts.

```python
# Load the trained gas optimization model
model = keras.models.load_model("gas_optimizer.h5")

# Example contract input features: [contract size, opcode count, loop depth, storage access]
contract_features = np.array([[800, 250, 5, 150]])

# Predict optimized gas cost
optimized_gas = model.predict(contract_features)
print("Optimized Gas Cost:", optimized_gas[0][0])

""",
    "What This AI Model Does": """
✅ **Trains a neural network** to **predict optimal gas costs**  
✅ **Uses historical contract data** to identify **gas-heavy patterns**  
✅ **Suggests gas-efficient modifications** for smart contract developers  
✅ **Saves the trained model** as `gas_optimizer.h5` for later use  
""",
    "Next Steps": """
To enhance the model, consider training with larger datasets that include real-world smart contract gas usage patterns.
Future improvements may integrate **Solana RPC data for real-time optimization recommendations**.
